What is $COMPX?

$COMPX is the native governance token of the CompX platform, granting holders voting rights on key protocol decisions—such as fees, treasury allocation, interest rates, and system upgrades.
The token is distributed through platform usage incentives, including liquidity provision, swaps, minting, burning, and other daily actions. CompX emits around 1,000,000 COMPX tokens weekly for these incentives.
🗳️ Governance Mechanics

Voting Power (“Flux”) is derived from:
Liquidity contributed (TVL)
COMPX LP holdings
Locked COMPX tokens
CompX is positioning itself as a fully community-governed DAO, enabling token holders to propose and vote on platform changes.
🎯 Utility & Use Cases

Participate in on-chain governance. May have thresholds for voting or creating proposals (specifics TBD).
Additional token rewards from staking, liquidity mining, and daily actions.
Help shape system parameters: fees, treasury disbursements, yield rates.
🔄 Earning & Staking COMPX

You can accumulate COMPX by engaging across the CompX ecosystem: using xUSD, providing liquidity, staking, or interacting with platform components.
Staking or locking COMPX increases your Flux, thereby growing your governance weight and access to further rewards.
📅 Timeline & Development

As of 2024, xBacked (the originator of xUSD) was integrated into CompX, and the governance token COMPX launched around that time.
CompX governance and rewards functionality went live earlier in 2025, confirming that early setup and reward distribution are already in progress.
✅ Why It Matters

Empowers decentralized decision-making.
Incentivizes long-term participation via liquidity and staking.
Bridges stablecoin utility (xUSD), protocol usage, and governance into a unified token economics model.
🔍 What’s Still TBD

The exact proposal threshold (e.g. minimum Flux) and quorum rules for voting haven’t yet been published.
Specific governance mechanics—voting durations, ability to delegate, timelock periods—haven’t been fully documented publicly yet.
🧩 Summary

COMPX functions as both a governance token and reward mechanism, encouraging participation in CompX's growing DeFi ecosystem. Governance power comes from locking, staking, and delivering liquidity. Although the platform is live and distributing tokens weekly, precise rules around voting thresholds and procedures are still evolving.
